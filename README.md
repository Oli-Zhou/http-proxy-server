How to run this program

```
sudo docker-compose up --build
```
Notes: you should first install docker-compose

```
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/<version>/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```
```
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

NOTES: `<version>` should be replaced by some version. In my case, it is `v2.16.0`

type `docker-compose --version` to check if it installs successfully
